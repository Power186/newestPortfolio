               <p> <b>Strengths:</b> Having spent 8 years treating, evaluating, and caring for patients in healthcare lends itself well to the processes and challenges associated with the responsibilities of an engineer. As such, my strongest skillsets include creative problem solving, working with ambiguity, visualizing and synthesizing complexities, optimizing systems, and being able to collaborate with a wide variety of perspectives.</p>
               <p> <b>Fun Fact:</b> At the age of 18, was contancted by a Physician at the University of Indiana School of Medicine to go to China and present topics in Sports Medicine at a world wide conference.
                   He thought I was a doctor. I wasn't a doctor, so I had to decline and graduate high school :).  It was great knowing my passion and knowledge for health and sports science was appreciated.
               </p>
               <p> <b>Hobbies:</b> Skateboarding, hiking, fitness, tea, camping, reading, researching, learning iOS / watchOS development, and legos.</p>
